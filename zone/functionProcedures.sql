/*
                    @Procedural Approach:
    1. Language Support: Supports procedural languages like PL/pgSQL, PL/Perl, PL/Python, etc.
    2. Complex Logic: Allows for complex logic using control structures like loops, conditionals, and exception handling.
    3. Variable Support: Supports variable declarations and manipulation within the procedural code.
    4. Stored Procedures/Functions: Provides the ability to create stored procedures or functions, 

                    @Non-Procedural Approach:
    1. Declarative Queries: Focuses on writing declarative SQL queries to retrieve, insert, update, or delete data from the database.
    2. Simplicity: Emphasizes simplicity by expressing operations in terms of what data is needed.
    3. SQL Functions: Supports SQL functions, which are single SQL statements that return a value or set of values.
    4. Performance: Can sometimes offer better performance for simple operations due to the optimized query execution plans generated by the database engine.
